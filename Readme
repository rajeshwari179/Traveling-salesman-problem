To run this code execute the following command in terminal:
python3 exec.py -inst <filename> -alg <algorithm> -time <cutoff_time> -seed <seed>

Example command would be:
python3 exec.py -inst Atlanta.tsp -alg LS -time 20 -seed 0
(here filename is Atlanta.tsp, LS is the algorithm code, cutoff_time is 20 seconds, seed=0)

If the data is stored in a folder, then ensure that the correct path is mentioned in the command.
